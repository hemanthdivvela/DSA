// defination of linked list 
1. What is link list with example?
Linked List: Definition. A linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element (called a node) is made up of two items: the data and a reference (or pointer), 
which points to the next node. A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node is connected to the next node through a pointer.

2. Are there linked lists in Golang?
Linked Lists are Dynamic in nature. In Golang Arrays we have to give size of the array while declaration, 
slice in golang uses arrays under the hood. The Linked List is a Dynamic Data Structure, it occupies memory only for the stored data.

3. Why linked list is better than array?
Better use of Memory:

From a memory allocation point of view, linked lists are more efficient than arrays. 
Unlike arrays, the size for a linked list is not pre-defined, allowing the linked list to increase or decrease in size as the program runs.

4. What are the five 5 basic operations on linked list?
Linked List Operations: Traverse, Insert and Delete
Traversal - access each element of the linked list.
Insertion - adds a new element to the linked list.
Deletion - removes the existing elements.
Search - find a node in the linked list.
Sort - sort the nodes of the linked list.

5. Is LinkedList a stack?
Linked list and stack are both linear data structures. The main difference is that Stack follows the LIFO(Last in, First out) principle, 
i.e., insertion and deletion can take place only at one end, whereas in a linked list, insertion and deletion can take place from any position.

6. Which is faster linked list or array?
If you want to search or access a specific element, arrays are faster, 
but if you want to insert or delete an element, a linked list is faster.
